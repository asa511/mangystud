I love MGSD, the TiddlyWiki? based GTD system for getting things done. Sadly, it lacks a few things I want it to have:

data hosted on the cloud
sync to phone (android)
shared tasks
I don't know if any such project exists, so I thought let me get started and see where it goes.

Also, a good project to learn grails/groovy.
