I love MGSD, the TiddlyWiki based GTD system for getting things done. Sadly, it lacks a few things I want it to have:

* MGSD gets very slow when tasks increase
* I need data hosted on the cloud
* sync to phone (android)
* shared tasks
* inbox processing 
* forward emails to inbox

I don't know if any such project exists, so I thought let me get started and see where it goes.

Besides, a good project to learn grails/groovy.
